# Introduction
We have developed our own cryptocurrency called VIT token. VIT token allows the users to securely send and receive money with maximum possible anonymity. We promote transparency thus our whole codebase will be open-sourced so that people can count on us when they make financial transactions.

# Methodology adapted
Developing an ERC-20 Token using Smart Contracts and hosting an ICO.
ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment and 20 is the proposal identifier) tokens differ from other cryptocurrencies such that they are based on Ethereum blockchain instead of having their own Blockchain. These exist to propose improvements to the Ethereum network. Therefore, we don’t need to create our blockchain which requires a lot of resources and nodes in the network with high computing powers.
ICO or Initial Coin Offering refers to the process of launching the cryptocurrency to the interested investors (pretty much like Initial Public Offering (IPO) in share market).
So for our project, we have used the Rinkeby Test Network, which is a version of the Ethereum network, mainly used for test purposes. Therefore, all the Ethers (tokens) exchanged on our network are not of any real value on the actual network.
Our project is a web-app that lets you interact with our cryptocurrency. This was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Our coin is based on the EIP protocol provided by Ethereum for setting up the Smart Contracts on Solidity.
We have developed 2 Smart Contracts for our project:
  • One for the coin (according to ERC-20 standard)
  • Other one for the token sale (ICO).
We have used Solidity as a language for our smart contacts. To implement Blockchain locally we used Ganache and Truffle framework using NodeJS. Lastly to connect to the Blockchain network the user needs to have the MetaMask extension on their web browser. Metamask also provides users with Ethers from their wallet which they can send and receive to test our currency as well as our network.
